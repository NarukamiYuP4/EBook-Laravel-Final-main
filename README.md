 <h1>About</h1>

 <br>
 
 
 <p>EBOOK is an Online Library web application project built using (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4.6</a>, <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel 9</a>).. The main goal of this application is to provide an online library service allowing users to borrow and read books online. Users can borrow books/return books. The User can also search for particular authors to search for books. The web application has Admin user functionality which allows admins to add/edit or delete books/authors in the Database. The admin can also make a normal user admin.
 Ebook works on a User credit system. A user can buy credits for money(payment systems not integrated) and use credits to borrow and read books. A book can be borrowed for a week, the user can also extend the borrowing period of a book by 7 days and will for credits. If the user fails to return or extend a book in a given time, a late fee is charged which is 1/3rd of the credit price of the books. The advance features of the application include:

<h2>User features</h2>

-   <p style="font-size:1.5rem">User/Admin functionality.Seperated logins,features and roles</p>
      <p>Purpose: To have seperate user and admin functionalities, I have created seperate dasboards for user and admins.<p>

-   <p style="font-size:1.5rem">Extending borrow period</p>
      <p>Purpose: A particular user can extend the borrowing period of a book by a week. The user will be charged 1/4th of the total credit price of the book. If the book is overdue, the user cannot read it untill he returns and re-borrows again or extends the borrowing period. The user will be charged a late fee for returing/extending after the due date. The late fee is 1/3rd of the credit price of the book<p>

<h1>Usage(User)</h2>

<p style="font-size:1.2rem" >I have implemented a credit system in my application. A user can borrow books for a week using his credits which can be bought. Each book has a price/credits to borrow. When the book is expired and the user wishes to read it further, a user can extend it for a week for a small credit amount. However, If a book is overdue and has passed it return date, a user cannot read it until it's extended which requires extra charges along with the regular extension price</p>

<h1>Reflective Analysis</h2>
<h2>Automated Reminder Email Feature</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The automated email feature is one of the most important features of this application. The Users can borrow books which they like for a certain period and then have to return the book or extend the loan period to avoid extra charges by borrowing it again. The application checks for each User borrowed books and checks for the return date of books using the getExpiryDate() method of the User model and sends an automated Reminder email to Users on deadline day </p>

<h3>Why this feature?</h3>
<p>The main motivation for the development of this feature is obvious, to reduce human effort. In a large user domain, sending a reminder email for each user is not possible for an admin, furthermore it helps the users to extend their loan period so they don’t have to borrow it again as it requires additional charges. If a user has borrowed a lot of books this feature becomes useful
</p>

</p>

<h3>Development & Technologies used</h3>

-   Creating a custom artisan command : Using php Artisan make, I created a custom command called ExpiryReminder.In the handle() method the logic of the command goes in. The command iterates over each User's borrowed books list and compares the current date with the Return date/Expiry date of the book, if it matches the command sends an email to the borrower/user of the book.
-   getExpiryDateFunction($id): The function belongs to the User model which takes book-id as the parameter and gets the date on which the book was borrowed by the user and adds 10 days to it as the borrowing period and returns the date.
-   Settinp up the Schedular:We have to set up the command that we would like to schedule (which in this case is ExprityReminder), inside the kernel.php file of the console folder. For this command to work efficiently, it should be scheduled daily at midnight.
-   Sending an email: Created a mailable class ExpiryReminderMail.php and the relevant view also set up the senders configuration in the .env file, the email contains the book name along with the return date for the book and is triggered whenever the expiry date matches the current date.
<h3>Usage & Demonstration<h3>
<p>I will demonstrate this feature using mailtrap.io. We have a user called Mohammad Khan and here are borrowed books.I have changed the schedular in the kernel to schedule every minute so as to demonstrate the command </p>

![My Image](/public/images/dm1.png)

<p>In command line run this command: 
 <p style="background-color:white; color:black;padding:5px;"> php artisan schedular:work </p>

 <p>Reminder Email on mailtrap</p>

![My Image](/public/images/dm2.png)

<h3>Alternatives<h3>
<p> One of the things I could have done differently is the method of getting the return/expiry date of a book. A model can be made for the pivot_table called for example Loaned item and return could be saved as one of the attributes of the model </p>
<p>
The Reminder email sends out a separate email for each book borrowed by the user, an alternative approach is if more than one book is overdue, the books could be saved in an array and a single email containing the list of books that are about to expire could be sent to the user

</p>

<br>

<h1>Application testing</h2>
<p>I have used feature testing to test the main fucntionality of the Application and also for route authorsiation and checks.
 The UserTest contains test for user actions except Book Crud and Author Crud, which are done in BookControllerTest and AuthorControllerTest.
 The following screenshots shows all the test that are run using:
<p style="background-color:white; color:black; padding:5px;"> php artisan test  </p>
